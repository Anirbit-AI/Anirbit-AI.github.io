     <p style="margin-top: 5px;"> 
     Partial differential equations (PDEs) are the ubiquitous way to model various system dynamics such as fluid flow or evolution of the quantum state of a molecule. Various applied sciences have a critical dependency on having fast and reliable numerical solvers for PDEs. However classical methods of simulating PDEs can be very expensive for very many instances of practical relevance. Hence large parts of the industry are trying to implement methods from Scientific-ML for these tasks. In our group we seek to marry deep ideas in mathematics with the foundational challenges of Scientific-ML - and push the frontiers of both. We aim to give methods of obtaining performance guarantees and uncertainty quantification for first-order algorithms which can be deployed to train neural operators and nets for solving any target PDE and dynamical system.

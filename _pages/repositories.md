Along with Prof. Samuel Kaski, I have been involved in helping PhD candidates get one of the highest university fellowships for graduate students - the Dean's Doctoral Scholarship. Hence maybe now I can say something about what is required to get this :) 

IMHO, doing a Ph.D. is an extremely important decision in life and it can have significant ramifications on everything about oneself. Probably naturally, the Ph.D. admission is a very long and complex process and it's very important to start preparing the documents as early as possible.  At our department, to have a chance at any of the important fellowships it is vitally important that the candidate has significant familiarity with their *intended* research field - just excellence in studies thus far is unlikely to cut it - I wrote a Ph.D. thesis on deep-learning while not knowing anything about neural nets till the middle of my first year of Ph.D. - unlikely this situation will fly here :D 

**So, to start a Ph.D. with me in the September of any year, ideally start having research discussions with me during the summer the year before ~ 1.5 years *before* the application deadline.** *I am assuming that at that point you already have demonstrable excellence in advanced maths/statistics/theoretical physics or E.C.E. courses -  could be via top grades in these mathematically intensive courses.* To maximize your chances, submit your applications (with the required TOEFL/IELTS scores) in December the year before - or definitely by March of the same year - though by then you would have already missed out on the chance to qualify for the President's Doctoral Scholar Award.  [This page](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/funding/) lists all the funding possibilities that you can explore for doing your Ph.D. at our department. 

(In particular, note if you qualify for any of the ``External Scholarships" listed therein.)

<h1> Almost Necessary Prerequisite Reading for Starting a PhD in Our Group </h1>
<h2> The students are expected to have evidence of satisfying at least 2 or more of the following criteria, </h2>

> (a) Know basics of stochastic optimization, like Chapter-6 [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4980)
> 
> (b) Know basic machine learning theory, like [these lectures](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rlivni/cos511/cos511.html)
> 
> (c) Have top grades in any one of the topics, like PDE theory/advanced analysis/mathematical statistics/differential geometry/probability theory/Fourier analysis

>>  The lectures above are from a group in ETH Zurich with whom we have a close relationship.

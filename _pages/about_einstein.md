I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the Department of Computer Science at University of Liverpool (UOL), United Kingdom. I am a part of the [Natural Language Processing group](https://livnlp.github.io/) at UOL. Before joining UOL, I worked with [Emine Yilmaz](https://sites.google.com/site/emineyilmaz/home/) as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Web Intelligence Group](https://wi.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) at University College London (UCL). I finished my PhD. in 2021 from Dublin City University, Ireland. My PhD. supervisor was [Gareth J.F. Jones](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~gjones). I was affiliated with [ADAPT centre Ireland](https://www.adaptcentre.ie/) during my PhD.

My work primarily lies at the intersection of Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML). More specifically, I am interested in developing socially responsible intelligent systems.

<b>AE at TMLR</b>

Delighted to have been inducted as an Action Editor (AE) of the, [Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/editorial-board.html). I have previously published 4 times in this journal and I have been highly convinced of how carefully papers are reviewed at TMLR. I eagerly look forward to contributing to upholding the high standards of reviewing that TMLR is setting.

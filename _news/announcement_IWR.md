<b>Invited Talk on Sci-ML @ the IWR, University of Heidelberg </b>

Thanks to the Heidelberg-Manchester collaboration grant with [Dr. Jakub Zech](https://jakobzech.com), I was hosted at their department. During the visit I had engaging meetings with his group as well as the co-PI, [Prof.Tobias Buck](https://tobias-buck.de)'s group. I also gave a talk at IWR on my works on necessary conditions on neural architecture sizes for scientific-ML/PDE solving via operator learning as well for PINN training. The slides I presented can be seen [here](https://github.com/Anirbit-AI/Slides-from-Team-Anirbit/blob/main/SciML_Lowerbound_Slides.pdf). This talk covered these two works of ours : on [lowerbounds on DeepONets (2024)](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=RwmWODTNFE) and [lowerbounds on PINNs (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06967).

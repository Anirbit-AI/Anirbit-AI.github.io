<b>Invited Talk on Sci-ML @ the College of Mathematical Medicine, Zhejiang Normal University</b>

Thanks to the invite of my collaborator [Prof. Theodore Papamakrkou](https://www.theopapamarkou.com), I was hosted at their department to give a talk on my works on necessary conditions on neural architecture sizes for scientific-ML/PDE solving via operator learning as well for PINN training. The slides I presented can be seen [here](https://github.com/Anirbit-AI/Slides-from-Team-Anirbit/blob/main/SciML_Lowerbound_Slides.pdf). This talk covered these two works of ours : on [lowerbounds on DeepONets (2024)](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=RwmWODTNFE) and [lowerbounds on PINNs (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06967).

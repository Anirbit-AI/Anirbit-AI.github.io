Our amazing co-author [Dibyakanti Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dibyakantik/) joins our group as a PhD student. 
He would be co-advised by [Prof. Alex Frangi](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/alejandro-frangi) and myself.  

Dibyakanti becomes the first student to begin their doctoral studies in our group!
